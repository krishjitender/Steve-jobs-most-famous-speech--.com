   <h2>STORY-1</h2>

Today I want to tell you three stories from my life.That's it.No big deal.Just three stories.The first story is about connecting the dots.I droped out from reed college after the first 
sixth months but then stayed around as a drop-in for around 18 months or so before I really quit.So why did I droped out? It started before I was born . My biological mother was a young ,
unwed graduate student and she decided to put me up for adoption.She felt very strong that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all setfor me to be adopted at birth
by a lawyer and his wife.Except that when I popped outthey decided at the last minutethat they really wanted a girl.Somy parents,who wre on a waiting list,got a call in the middle of the 
night asking;"We've got an unexpected baby boy;do you want him?".They said:"Of course".My biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my 
father had never graduated from high school.She refused to sign the final adoption papers.She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college.This was
the start in my life.And 17 years later I did go to college. But I nalvely chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford,and all of my working-class parents' savings were being 
spend on my college tution, After six months,I couldn'tsee the valuein it.I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.And here 
I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life.So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK.It was pretty scary at that time,but looking back it
was one of the best decisions I ever made.The minute I dropped outI could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me,and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more 
interesting.It wasn't all romantic.I didn't have a dorm room,so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms,I returned coke bottles for the 5 cents deposits to buy food with,and I would walk 
the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a weekat the Hare Krishna Temple.I loved it.And much of what I stumbled into by folling my curiosity ans intution turned out
to be priceless later on.Let me give you one example:
                                            Reed College at that time offered perhapsthe best calligraphy instruction in the country.Throughout the campus every poster,every label
on every drawer was beautifully hand calligraphed.Because I had droppedout and didn't have to take the normal classes.I decided to take a calligraphy class to learnhow to do this.I learned
about serf and san serf typefaces,about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations,about what makes great typography great.It was beautiful,historical,artistically
subtle in a way that science can't capture,and I found it fascinating.None of this had ever a hope of any practical application in my life.But 10 years later when we were designing the  
first Macintosh computer,it all came back to me.And we designed it all into the Mac.It was the first computer with the beautiful typography.If I had never dropped in on that single course
in college,the Mac would have never had multiple typefacesor proportionally spaced fonts.And since Windows just copy the Mac,it's likely that no personal computer would have them.If I had
never droppedout,I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class,and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do.
                                                                                                                                            Of course, it was impossible to connect
the dots lokking forward when I was in college.But it was very,very clear looking backwards 10 years later .Again you can't connect the dots looking forward;you can only connect them 
looking backwards.So you have to trust that the dots willsomehow connect in your future.You have to trust in something -your gut,destiny,life,karma,whatever.Because believing that the dots
will connect down the road will give you the confidenceto follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn pathand that will make all the difference.

 <h2>STORY-2</h2>   
<PRE><BIG>
My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20.We worked hard,and in 10 years 
Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation-the Macintosh-a year earlier, and i had 
just turned 30. And then i got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew, we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me,and
for the first yearor so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him.So at 
30, I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and I was devastating. I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had 
let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down-that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up 
so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me-I still loved what I did.The turns of events at Apple
had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over. I didn't see it then, but turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best
thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successfulwas replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one 
of the most creative periods of my life. During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my
wife. Pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. I a remarkable turns of events,
Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together. I'm 
pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. 
                                                                      It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life is going to hit you in the 
head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for work as it
is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work
is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. And don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it 
just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don't settle.

 <h2>STORY-3</h2>

My third story is about Death. When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like:"If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right." It made an 
impression on me. And since then, for past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror early morning and asked myself:"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about
to do today?" And whenever the answer has been"No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. Remembering that I"ll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever
encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything-all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure- these things just fall away in 
the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are 
already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we 
all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It's life change agent. It clears out the old to make
way for the new. Right the new is you,but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true. Your time is
limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma-which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions 
drown out your own inner voice. And most important have the courage to follow your heart and intution. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.
